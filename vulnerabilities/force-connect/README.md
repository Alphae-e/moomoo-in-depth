# Force connect

> **Force connect** - is a script that allows you to connect to the full server

Every server can contain up to `50` players, but there's a strictly limited number of players who can connect to the server `40`.

### Large servers
In old versions of the game there were large servers:
- London 1
- Frankfurt 1

they could contain up to `80` players and `90` with force connect

### Versions
The first version of force connect used a socket url replacement technique
